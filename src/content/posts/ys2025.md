As the name suggests, if what we write every day is a diary (daily record), then what we write every year must be a yearly record!  
Although it's called a yearly record, it's actually written one week before Christmas, on the day when Nagato Yuki changed the world.

$$
\Gamma(z) = \frac{1}{z} - \gamma - \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (-1)^n z^{n-1} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{(-1)^k}{k!} \zeta(n-k+1) \Gamma^{(k)}(1)\\{}\\

Looking back at the goals set at the beginning of the year:

$$
\begin{array}{||l|c||}
\hline \hline
\mathrm{\textbf{Items}} & \mathrm{\textbf{State}} \\
\hline \\
{\color{red}\times}\,\text{Complete high school math, physics, and chemistry studies} &({\color{#CCCC29}2}/{\color{#00CC00}3})\\

$$

Completed a total of (0/4), a complete failure.  
At least I finished the main storyline, which is good. However, my progress in regular classes is too advanced, reaching municipal-level excellence. Whether to retire from competitive programming (AFO) and become a pure whk (regular academic) student remains to be considered.

- Favorite song: "Sincerely"  
- Favorite movie: "Eagle Fighter: The Final Impact"
- Favorite anime: "Beyond the Boundary"
- Favorite content creators: Animenz, Touch Hands (pianists)

## Major Events
#### 2025.1.1   
Celebrated New Year's with dormmates [dhl](https://www.luogu.com.cn/user/1357229) and lk. In the early morning, climbed Lianhua Mountain with dhl, [yh2023zlh](https://www.luogu.com.cn/user/1396080), and [Liuhy2996](https://www.luogu.com.cn/user/676520). In the afternoon, Liuhy2996's father gifted me a ping pong paddle${}^2$.

#### 2025.2.3 - 2.9
Officially joined yh's math competition team, made good friend lyd. Stayed at yyc's house and finished all his manga collection. Borrowed his "The Story of Imaginary Numbers" and embarked on my journey into complex analysis.

#### 2025.5.1 - 5.5
Was confined to a training camp with [yh2022mayu](https://www.luogu.com.cn/user/541786), during which my AT rating reached $1200$, but I never played again afterward. Discovered Land Battle Chess - really fun.

#### 2025.7.15 - 8.16
Joined ZR (Zhengrui) summer courses, but honestly struggled a lot. Met c8n and hwy, performed quite poorly in several mock contests. Successfully got dormmates hooked on Dead Cells and ADOFAI, and personally achieved flawless perfect runs on XO-X and XT-X levels. Later moved to Liuhy2996's dorm. Participated in ZR's concert, sang "Dan" by Grass Mud Horse. A senior student's performance of "Sakura Nagashi" was exceptionally good. After playing basketball, I coincidentally ran into him playing piano version of "A Cruel Angel's Thesis".  

Set up a Minecraft server${}^3$ account in the dorm: AnbyDemara_, and built a territory with yh2023zlh's character Liouxt. Seriously bow to the hardcore player yh2023zlh - under server restrictions that banned high-frequency redstone and TNT, he manually mined $96$ stacks of spruce wood, giving me a solid foundation for my constructions. Everyone is welcome to visit our territory AL!  
Formed an ACM team with a senior from Shenzhen Foreign Languages School and another from Guangdong Experimental School. Participated in ZR ACM and achieved a good ranking of 24th place. Treated them to Mixue Bingcheng drinks. Drew Grass Mud Horse's logo on the awarded balloons and hung them on the balcony - pretty hilarious.

## Timeline
Should start from **2024.12.31**.  
School ended early that day, around 5 PM, and I went with Liuhy2996 to Chiban Old Bowl House - a noodle restaurant I particularly love. After eating, we took bubble tea to his place and enjoyed a night of ZZZ (likely a game). That day was extremely pleasant as I recall, but specific details have faded. Around 9:30 PM, we returned to school. dhl and zlh were still watching "Record of Ragnarok" shown by Teacher Cai Hua. After returning, I tidied up the classroom, played Spider Solitaire for a while. dhl went out for dinner, and zlh left to meet his family at a nearby hotel. Alone in the classroom watching Ragnarok, dhl soon returned after dinner, so we watched together. Around 11 PM we returned to the dorm, bringing back all remaining snacks and drinks from the classroom. Tried to take a shower but there was no hot water for ages, so I just wiped my body with cold water - nearly froze to death! dhl tried later and somehow got hot water - what's going on? lk rushed back before New Year's. According to him, he borrowed a bicycle with classmates to visit "Spring Bamboo" (Shunzhu) landmark and watched a movie. The three of us placed a radio (actually a smartwatch function) on the table and sat around playing cards. It was the final game of 2024, all three of us were extremely cautious, thinking through every move for a long time... Finally!!!! No, just kidding - lk won. The countdown began, and amid the host's excited voice:
$$ $$

# $\text{Happy New Year!}$

**2025.1.1** The three of us toasted with cola that had been sitting for a whole year, starting the first card game of the new year. Again, lk won. Made instant noodles (still Tangdaren${}^4$), so delicious delicious delicious delicious. Played until around 2 AM and then slept. Woke up naturally around 9:30 AM. Without waking lk, dhl and I ate at the breakfast stall outside school gates, then played ping pong in front of the classroom (still using yh2023zlh's paddle at that time). dhl's playing was... indescribable, pure forehand $J=0$ spin rotation. Around that time, Liuhy2996 called us to the school gate where he and his father had been waiting. Used his mobile data to update "Honkai: Star Rail," yh2023zlh arrived soon after, and we headed to Lianhua Mountain together. On the way, yh2023zlh shared that he had gotten a $0+1$ Nekomiya Mana gacha pull last night (I already had $1+1$), incredibly lucky. Nothing special happened during the Lianhua Mountain climb. After reaching the summit, we discussed afternoon plans, suggesting to watch "One Hundred Thousand Heartbeats"${}^5$, but it was rejected. After discussion, we unanimously agreed on playing ping pong. Had lunch at Old Bowl House, indulging ourselves, and received a gift from Liuhy2996's father: `New Year's Shulker Box=[lotus biscuits*3, ping pong paddle, bottle of water]`. The biscuits were delicious. Played ping pong all afternoon at the upper level of a shopping mall, establishing the skill ranking:
$$
\text{Liuhy2996}\,\sim\,\text{yh2023zlh}\,\gg\,\text{Anby\_}\,\ge\,\text{dhlyjsp}
$$
yh2023zlh's backhand skills are incredible!!! Extremely proficient twisting technique. Awesome! After learning topspin shots from wjx, I could finally exchange some decent rallies with Liuhy2996. When tired, it was already dinner time. The four of us had dinner at a restaurant near Liuhy2996's home (the food wasn't great, so I won't mention the restaurant name). Then returned to school, using "completing homework" as an excuse to continue playing ping pong all evening, satisfying our ping pong cravings. Other dormmates gradually returned to school as well.

After that came ordinary final exam review preparation, but results were terrible, and I lost part of my scholarship.

Only attended 3 out of 5 days of winter vacation training, but results were good enough to have a nice New Year. After finishing the informatics training came math competition training, mostly high school mathematics and junior high mathematics league courses. Just as we entered this busy new season,

**2025.1.21 Grandfather passed away**

My condolences. Rushed back to hometown for the funeral, but couldn't shed tears no matter how hard I tried. As the only adult male in the family, I couldn't grieve properly for my grandfather's passing - I truly deserve to die. Only grandmother remains among the elders - it's the elderly who hold a family together. When they're gone, the family scatters too. Now only one elder remains in this family - how long can this paper-thin bond last? In her final years, I feel I can do nothing to help. Most frightening is that I can't even speak my hometown dialect, unable to understand what she means. I can do nothing, only hope grandmother stays healthy.

After the New Year, started studying math competitions. Returned to school for training on the fourth day of Chinese New Year, when dorms weren't open yet, temporarily staying at yyc's house. Searched through 114514 math textbooks at yyc's place, discovered "The Story of Imaginary Numbers" - truly an excellent publication with many great examples, systematic explanation of Cauchy's integral theorem and some introduction to residue theorem, unfortunately now out of print. First encountered ADOFAI at yyc's house, first level played was "One Forgotten Night" - got tricked badly.  
First met lyd during self-study in the math competition classroom, when only $\in\{\text{me\,,\,lyd}\}$ were present. I was planning to slowly read the "Hikaru no Go" manga I found at yyc's house in the classroom, but lyd discovered it. To avoid getting reported, I had to let him read it with me. Shockingly, lyd became obsessed immediately, fantasizing about becoming Hikaru Shindo himself. After reading a few manga volumes, he thought he could beat me easily, refusing to accept handicap stones, proposing that he'd win if he got fifty points ahead - still hasn't won a single game to this day.  
Successfully brought my computer to the math competition classroom, watching "Cat Tea" anime with classmates while slacking off.

Good times pass quickly. Blink and it's almost semester start, homework completely untouched - doomed. On the day of return, asked yh2023zlh when he'd be back, only to learn he had transferred to Huizhou No.1 High School - heartbroken. He was an excellent person with steady character and agile thinking. In OI, despite studying for only one year, he surpassed me. He had unique insights into many conclusions. Being from the "soup tribe," he once brought a massive amount of snacks to the dorm - the scene was something like:  

$\,\,\,\textbf{19:20:00}\,\,114514\le\left|\text{suitcase}\right|\le\infty$  
$\,\,\,\textbf{19:20:01}\,\,\text{suitcase}=\emptyset$  

${}^\ast\textbf{Snack consumption speed be like:}$
$$
f(t)=e^{-2t^2}\\
{}\\
\tiny{\text{\TeX is so good to use, you know?}} 
$$  
~~Oh, and I still haven't returned that pudding I borrowed.~~ Our dorm had a "Party Day" tradition - every Thursday we'd share all snacks collected during the week to get through the most difficult day (suspected to be Crazy Thursday). This later evolved into a series of coded terms: PHC ($\text{Pao'mian}^6\,\text{ Hot water}\,\text{ Cup noodles}$) operations and such. Left behind massive memories in the dorm. His smartwatch contains numerous dorm footage materials like "Unlocking New Characters." I remember after I changed watches, my SD card was often not recognized, so I'd borrow yh2023zlh's NetEase Cloud Music to listen to songs (later played Douyin videos making him uninstall NetEase Cloud).  
Though he's gone, I was sad for a very long time. Misfortunes never come alone - lk, who also had scholarship reduced, switched to day student status.

Started grinding the regular classes storyline, but performed terribly on monthly and mid-term exams. Oh, I suddenly remembered watching a video:  

$$
\text{Today's parents are all "power-level focused players,"}\\
\text{they only consider their "characters" qualified if they deal big numbers}\\{}\\
\text{\color{red} They don't look at mechanisms at all!!!}\\{}\\
\text{Even though they have very limited resources,}\\
\text{they invest everything in useless skills,}\\\text{yet still expect their "characters" to deal explosive damage!!}
$$

Truly power-level focused.  
Applied for class suspension to focus on math league. Coinciding with May Day holiday, planned to go out and play? No, confined to math training camp (math concentration camp), but since yh2022mayu was there too, it was fine. Played mini metro on classmates' phones - fun fun. Courses were two days algebra and two days geometry, learned 
$$
\frac{3-\ln4-2\displaystyle\sum_{m=2}^\infty(-1)^m\beta(m,2)\left(1-\frac1m\right)}{\ln\left(\large\frac4\pi\right)+\displaystyle\sum_{m=1}^\infty\frac{\zeta(m+1)}{m+1}(-2)^{1-m}}=2
$$ 
problems (spent so long making up this formula QAQ), both series likely converge to $\gamma$ anyway. Math competitions are too hard - learned $114514$ inequalities but only know how to use AM-GM and Cauchy-Schwarz, mainly because I can only prove these two. Can't think of others during contests, maybe Jensen's inequality too? Once during a high league mock test I thought of it, but found AM-GM solved most problems anyway. Still, the absolute value inequality is the most useful in the world - from triangles to integrals, absolute value inequality always comes in handy. Oh, starting geometry now? Proving axioms from other axioms? Interesting, solved $0$ problems. There was some theorem about six-point circle or something - solved it, but only after $\frac10$ hints from a senior, but it was really clever!!! Turns out triangles have so many "centers"? I'm just too weak. Euler's theorem is really impressive - I was confused for $0$ seconds, you try it too! Could there really be $\frac{GH}{HI}=\frac{1}{2}$? Oh, I can prove it now, midline theorem is so useful. What about the problems after this? Can't solve them.  
So I started slacking off. Learning Land Battle Chess or military chess? Seems fun. Oh, I understand the rules now. Wait, how did my general die?! How did my mine die?! How did sappers sneak into my base!?? え? How did I lose? Land Battle Chess is too hard, never playing it again. Got chance to play ABC contests at night, didn't know it would be the last time. Solved quickly, mastered ABCDE, spent $\varepsilon$ time passing them, couldn't understand F, solved G - wait I passed, wait I reached blue rating. Slacked off.  
May Day training finally ended, completely exhausted. Right after training came the high league preliminary exam, already burned out. Skipped classes to slack off in math competition classroom, could also play ping pong - ideal days. So many provinces have already taken preliminary exams? Looking at questions, why so difficult, why am I so weak, how are passing scores so high!? Bad news, probably won't pass preliminary exam, better study advanced algebra. Earlier this year took a CACA exam, failed badly, math $2$ barely passed with no ranking, but seemingly highest score in math competition classroom. Studied hard on algebra - too difficult, what's the meaning of quadratic forms, why does this thing exist, can't understand at all, don't know what I'm doing. Learned many standard forms, feels like Jordan form is better, don't know what number theory standard form is for.

How is it already time for the high league main exam? Better slack off, when else to relax before exams? Played on class computers, finally cleared "Last Hope," now the high league became the last hope. dhlyjsp demanded I sleep early, couldn't refuse, so I slept.
Next day still ate breakfast at Xiangmei Market, this time at Jingtian Beef Shop's cheung fun, tasted quite good actually. Arrived at Liuhy2996's home gate, waited a while for other classmates then departed. Forgot the exam site name, doesn't seem like a prestigious school. Campus so big. Oh found the exam room, papers being distributed, high league first part so difficult, solved all multiple choice and second big problem, time ran out after finishing. Waited a while for second part, first question some mysterious geometry? Can't solve, wrote random nonsense. Second question, extremely tricky, randomly guessed the maximum value equality condition:

$
\text{\textbf{Solution:}}\text{Note that when }x_1=x_2=x_3=x_4=1,x_5=0\text{, } S=12.$  
$\text{Next prove }S\le12\text{:}$

That's it, surprisingly got $10$ points for this - too merciful. After leaving exam hall and discussing with classmates, discovered I failed $\frac10$ problems, no chance for finals. Eh? Why did the coach get me back in?! Must thank the coach then. Coach was apparently 2007 CMO rank 13 silver medalist. According to Han's calculation method, there were 100 gold medals in 2023 CMO, with gold medal count doubling each previous year, reverse calculation shows 2007 had $1.3\times10^{-7}$ gold medals, so rank 13 not getting gold makes sense. Though in earlier competition years, provincial first prize could guarantee university admission - missed that era's benefits QAQ.  
With monthly exams following immediately, unprepared, performed terribly. Finally could relax. Speaking of which, during this period cracked the homeroom teacher's computer password, used classroom computers to play "Ice and Fire" - mainly practicing to maintain skill, unexpectedly cleared all levels. Might as well download some music sheets to play, found "Turkish March" most suitable for playing with classmates - this rage-inducing song is perfect for making classmates rage too, then mocking them. Turns out student-era happiness is built on father-son relationships. Classmate bought new keyboard, planning to bring next day, but that night forgot to return classroom keyboard to its place, eventually exposed. As homeroom teacher said: "If you walk by the river often, your shoes will get wet." Ultimately received $0$ punishments, then discovered at night teacher changed the password. lk's mechanical keyboard was actually quite comfortable to use, cleared "it go" with it.  
But speaking of it, to secure scholarship, had to start studying whk (regular classes), so returned to classroom, studying complex analysis during classes instead. How is returning to classroom no different from not returning? There is a difference - can't play chess during class anymore. Didn't have biology/geography exams, so gained much free time, but didn't learn anything particularly special. After withdrawing from school physics competition team, haven't studied physics for long time, so took out university physics textbook! Started reviewing physics content. Mechanics is really simple, basically just analytic geometry using calculus. Skipped optics. Electricity is hard, how can there be complex impedance? Complex analysis finally useful. Physics' only really difficult equation is Schrödinger's equation - actually a second-order partial differential equation, never understood it, dizzy. Physics doesn't have many difficult integrals, generally university math can directly analyze them, so residue theorem gathering dust again. However, complex number methods are truly useful - separating real and imaginary parts for integration, or converting trigonometry to exponentials is really handy, extending to many things like Laplace transforms commonly used in physics, and particularly useful Ramanujan Master Theorem! But I've already written a dedicated article${}^7$ about it, so I'll just present it:
:::note[Ramanujan Master Theory]{open}
If function $f(x)$ can be expanded as the following series:
$$
f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{\phi(n)}{n!}(-x)^n
$$
then the Mellin transform:
$$
\int_0^\infty x^{s-1}f(x)\,\mathrm dx=\Gamma(s)\phi(-s)
$$
holds.
:::
This method works wonders for calculating dhl integrals${}^8$.  
Only one week left, must prepare for regular classes or I'm doomed!! Didn't review for two days before exams, even played all night - Identity V is so fun. Didn't review at all, took exams naked again, but this time no biology/geography, should be easier. Could still watch Frieren in the evening, nice. After physics exam, classmates couldn't contain their excitement - graduated from middle school. This excitement gradually transformed to inexplicable sadness - though we'll likely be in the same class in high school, right? Took graduation photos with homeroom teacher, coach, "sons" (close friends), and entire class, then went out to play. Liancheng New World's ACG Town seemed most fun, eventually ended up at Book City. Returned to school, classmates gradually left, classroom empty except for me. In dormitory, classmates gradually took their belongings away, dormitory empty except for me. Looking at the empty dormitory, a deep loneliness welled up in my heart. Unable to suppress anxiety and other complex emotions, hid in the dormitory crying alone.  

Next day was informatics training, only one week this year - shortest in history. Interestingly, after lunch returned to school but gate wouldn't let us in, forced to continue playing Silkroad at lhy's home. False, called back by classmates. Five-day training went surprisingly well - Yaohua's final song of praise. Good that homeroom teacher still came to school on weekdays, otherwise would've died of loneliness. Often went out to play though, with excellent dormmate [yhcjr](https://www.luogu.com.cn/user/1772249) - truly one of the best times at Yaohua. Return day revealed exam results - class rank 11, completed amazing comeback from consistently bottom of grade to grade rank 15, very satisfying result, finally secured scholarship. Chinese score actually reached $90$ this time - highest in history, finally became human. Left many relics on classroom computers, previous year's seniors also left much, but computers were replaced and everything disappeared. This time must properly pass on the fully-cleared "Ice and Fire" save file. Also left many easter eggs in the computer, copied many songs, played until homeroom teacher left. (What if homeroom teacher heard Aponia's personal song? What if homeroom teacher searched Zenless Zone Zero, then became an Anby fan?) Liuhy2996 scolded me for having delusions.  

**Is it over?** Completed Yaohua's main storyline. Wrote until crying, took long time to recover.  

Summer vacation should finally be relaxing. (Originally wanted to insert Black Bridge keeper's image here, but felt inappropriate, so left as is). Played games revengefully for a week, remember going out with yhcjr, buying bubble tea at noon, accidentally bought jasmine tea instead of jasmine milk tea. First sip tasted great! More sips revealed it was trash. Luckily yhcjr gave me their mango pomelo sago or I would've died of embarrassment. Lunch with him in classroom eating instant noodles, really comfortable - classroom only had us two, tables placed in middle, playing on computer, mainly watching Frieren. Oh, still used my bowl and chopsticks. After wasting a week, thrown into ZR training camp. Good news: Liuhy2996 would come too. Bad news: he'd arrive half a month later. Assigned a good dormitory, my bed by window, dormmates were all experts - one from Henan, one from Shandong, both seemed to have excellent high school entrance exam scores, though mine wasn't bad either. ZR training content was quite good, first few days on segment trees were okay, learned many tricks, passed many template problems. Had Tsinghua top 10 singers perform during self-study period, though hadn't heard original songs, sang really well.  
Later wanted to order bubble tea, discovered insufficient for delivery minimum, so asked dormmates to order too, dormmate directly paid for me (ありがとう！！！！！！), Mixue Bingcheng so delicious. Later skipped self-study, whole dorm slacking off, only attended when competitions happened. Good thing I brought portable wifi, dorm had no network, excessive! Three dormmates played Minecraft together, built a reasonably good house - feels different playing with good friends! Though mostly I just couldn't stand matchbox-style buildings, built slightly larger structures, then materials exploded, especially wood planks (when I accidentally crafted $12$ stacks of wood planks into $768$ wooden buttons), consumption was super high, so asked others to farm materials, then dormmates thought Minecraft wasn't fun anymore. Also played Dead Cells, showed off no-damage clears through first two cells in front of them, though got hit by giant in third cell, could've shown off more if I had parried - guess I'm getting old. Entire dorm got into Dead Cells, my heavens dormmate cleared first cell after just two days of playing - turns out he used cheat engine, never mind then. Every self-study period spent lined up playing in dorm. Henan dormmate could read sheet music surprisingly well, learned while playing Genshin Impact. Shandong dormmate brought Slay the Spire, but so difficult - played for over a week without reaching floor 3 (or whatever it's called, don't remember), why is learning curve so steep, feeling inferior, went back to Ice and Fire.  
Eh? How do you know I achieved flawless perfect on One Forgotten Night? Finally cleared it go in one try, really exhausting, one death means restart from beginning, mental breakdown. Playing Ice and Fire got discovered, so entire dorm started playing Ice and Fire. Dormmates needed over ten tries to pass 1-X? Feels a bit weak. Ice and Fire really makes people rage, but the fun comes from playing with others! Eh? I think I already said this.

Finally made it to August!!! Zhengrui still training, but Liuhy2996 arrived too. Didn't pick him up, don't know how he got here. Finally someone to play ping pong with - never dared to play with others at court, could only watch from side, after others played poorly still couldn't speak up, strange atmosphere at court, so never went again. Finally have someone I know - didn't meet many people at training camp, too socially anxious. Moved to Liuhy2996's dormitory, dormmates were Shenzhen Middle School experts, strangers. Barely exchanged words, scary. Every time slacking off in dorm saw them seriously solving problems, started feeling inferior, couldn't enjoy games comfortably, but didn't want to solve problems either. August brought many activities. First was concert - wanted to sing "Dan" for ages, finally chance to fully express myself, I'm definitely not socially anxious! Why so fast, I'm on stage already! Off-key, feeling inferior. Eh? QQ group actually has compliments for me, happy.  
No particularly surprising performances, but why play "Spring Day Shadow" (Soyo's theme). One person brought electric guitar on stage, plus violin, performed "Qinhuangdao," but no drums, not rhythm guitar either, hard to control verse and chorus transitions, felt empty, difficult to push rhythm forward. Could've played constant snare drum accompaniment in background as metronome - simplest way to improve progression feeling. Bass could've been included too. That said, singing was good. Later some unfamiliar songs, overall decent. A senior from Guangdong Experimental School sang "Sakura Nagashi," so good, could see Nagisa Kaworu playing piano. Feels like EVA new theater edition theme songs by Hikaru Utada can be ranked:
$$
\text{"Sakura Nagashi"}>\text{"One Last Kiss"}>\text{"Beautiful World"}\times 2
$$
Worldwide release of "The End" already happened, why not import to China?! Xin Chuang Hua is the real pigeon king, already $4$ years passed, listened to $4$ years of "One Last Kiss" but still no release. By the way, this senior's ping pong skills were decent too, at least had good accuracy. Often saw him playing with alumni from same school. Remembered borrowing his ball once, got his contact information. Once returning from ping pong with Liuhy2996, coincidentally saw the senior playing piano - seemed to be Animenz's arrangement of "A Cruel Angel's Thesis," my favorite song at that time! Though not smooth yet, managed to piece together a decent melody, but rhythm still lacking, needs more practice. The arpeggio in intro clearly showed hard effort, but poor control of dynamics made ornamental notes overpower main melody, greatly reducing expressiveness.  
hwy closed the show with "Night Navigation Star," haven't watched "My Three Body" but could feel deep emotion - verse vocals conveyed much struggle yet powerlessness, chorus surged powerfully (original song didn't express this well), used many delayed beats creating grand narrative, then returned to verse. Overall quite full-bodied, might watch this highly-rated animation next year (laugh).  

After concert, continued rushing "Brief Introduction to Complex Analysis," wrote until next day's early morning, too tired to continue, went to sleep. Next day was ACM! Already formed team! One teammate was a senior I took classes with in Shenzhen, another from Guangdong Experimental School. Forgot competition process, directly copying what I originally wrote:  
Formed an abstract team, from team formation to competition end, group chat had total 5 messages, 4 sent by me, quite cold. First blood balloon was Nai Long (cartoon dragon), hilarious - 18 people in class claim to be Nai Long, 9 from Guangdong Experimental School, GDSY too abstract, leaves no grass standing wherever it goes. First half hour of competition, I contributed 8 penalty attempts, no longer dared to use computer, let teammates take over and rapidly solved 4 problems, feeling inferior. Finally got 7 problems in three hours, then spent an hour on problem H without understanding, displayed middle school level Chinese reading ability, started slacking off, gave computer to female teammate, watched anime. Last half hour, stabilized at rank 29 (official contestants rank 24), first place among official contestants was surprisingly lkr, a second-year student from Tie Yi Middle School, alone, feeling inferior again. Ordered milk tea, planned to get after competition. During meal discovered delivery changed to self-pickup, I'm Nai Long, reordered, then heavy rain started, couldn't get delivery, left for two hours, when received, sundae was soup.  
After ACM nothing particularly special happened, daily life felt like clearing daily quests:
$$
class\rightarrow \text{eat}\rightarrow \text{listen to music}\rightarrow \text{class}\rightarrow \text{eat}\rightarrow \text{play ping pong}\rightarrow \text{play games}
$$
By the way, set a miraculous record at Zhengrui of living on $50$ yuan for $7$ days - chose not to drink congee for breakfast, just soy milk. For lunch and dinner chose no rice, just dishes, each under 3 yuan, then slipped into rice queue, quite frugal. Though once got caught, pretended to wear headphones not hearing anything, then escaped - too embarrassing QAQ.  
Zhengrui days ending soon, competition performance was trash. Last day stayed up all night gaming with Liuhy2996, dormmates playing Valorant. Ordered KFC at night, sundae melted again QAQ, but felt somewhat empty - corridor completely dark, only green emergency exit lights on both sides of wall. Got scared making instant noodles. Returned to dorm found dormmate tossing bottles, secretly photographed. Next day had high-speed train, ultimately decided to sleep after watching "The End" once more, around $4:30\,\text{am}$.  
Returned home with Liuhy2996 by high-speed rail, transferred once at Panyu Station, taking Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong line. I got off at Humen, Liuhy2996 continued one more stop to Shenzhen North, so we parted ways. Already afternoon when arrived home.  

Nothing particularly special happened.

September transferred to a rural school in Dongguan, then slacked off. In an ordinary class, $8$ subject teachers teaching just me, apparently became key cultivation target, but no intention to attend classes, still studying university mathematics during lessons. Started abstract algebra - Peking University math textbooks are truly impressive, able to be ultra-thin A5 size while including numerous exercises and proofs for every concept, quite absurd. Preparing for high league finals, visited Shenzhen - Shenzhen Middle School campus really huge. Solved all first part problems, felt relatively simple. Didn't plan to do second part, so slept. Proctor woke me up, had no choice but to start, discovered second problem was easy, hand-waved solution and started writing, didn't finish, estimated score $(0,150]$.  
Outside found everyone solved second problem, I'm fvv. Exchanged with Liuhy2996, discovered failed ten thousand problems, wasted another year. First part second problem transformed to plane incorrectly, pity. Played with Liuhy2996 all the way back, saw him home first.  

Preliminary exam solved instantly.

Don't want to write about what happened at new school, no sense of belonging, most failed school ever seen.

National Day holiday went to find yhcjr, unexpectedly GBC offline store required reservation, traveled all the way to Joy City but couldn't enter, great sadness. Went to ACG Town, couldn't find new Anby goods, great sadness. Suddenly remembered Zenless Zone Zero collaboration, set out to find it - sold out, pity. Still bought bubble tea, yhcjr and I got Jasmine First Snow milk tea. Gangxia North Station really huge. Took subway back to Yaohua, played on classroom computers - new computer has no password! Cleared computer memory, copied K-On! into it. Played a while, discovered already 5 PM, time flew. Went for dinner, discovered Zhen Gongfu at Xinwen Road closed, ate at Hong Li Village opposite. Missed high-speed train, went to Book City to play instead~ Read complex analysis books at Book City, nothing special. yhcjr is physics competition expert.  

"The End" finally released in theaters!!! But called "Eagle Fighter: The Final Impact," what did they crop from original film, can't even see Asuka. Normal scenes cropped too. But when "One Last Kiss" started playing, felt something, 29 yuan worth it. whk, bombed finals, nothing to say. Sad for long time, discovered qualified for NOIP, why be sad then. Escaped from regular classes. Set up blog, looks nice, but in English, don't want to write translations, so became English site. Wrote some articles, but still feels empty.

Went to Shenzhen for NOIP, played all night with yh2023zlh, normally played on server online, this time offline. Mostly fixing iron farms, didn't really play much. Had satisfying PvP with zlh, then got shredded by his dungeon materials. You're right, but building is really fun - just have zlh collect materials, then slowly idle. Next day was NOIP, met with牢 classmate.

Later lyd came to Dongguan to find me, played Phigros all day, bought many things, many meals. Updated paper a bit then saw him off. Then came THUPC2026 preliminary contest, returned to Yaohua again, saw Coach Chen, felt same guilt as with dhlyjsp, but whatever. Formed team with kaikatandy and Liuhy2996 called AKAM, plus 5 computers, 8 people only solved two problems, hilarious. Had lunch at KFC, treated by Chen. Saved roast chicken wings to eat slowly, Liuhy2996 stole them. Was working on J, but Liuhy2996 came up with weird conclusion, kaikatandy brute forced and matched, then guessed, failed ten thousand attempts, discovered it actually exists on OEIS?! Solemnly condemn Liuhy2996 for playing "Currency War" for 3 hours. Evening had dinner with lyd at Zhen Gongfu, then went to Book City. My heavens!!! Anby pendant!!! Bought it!!! So adorable!!!

How is it already Christmas, yh2023zlh built Christmas square in town, super cute!!! Nothing happened after that. New Year's played New Year's contest, solved ABCD in one hour then slacked off. 

First time celebrating New Year with server people, unexpectedly yh2023zlh couldn't stay up late, so I played Cat Country instead.

Can't write anything poetic, but so sentimental. Why so empty? I ask myself.

## Notes
1. Roughly divided into four categories: "Advanced Mathematics," "Advanced Algebra," "Abstract Algebra," "Probability Theory and Mathematical Statistics"
2. Galaxy 5-star finished paddle, forehand slightly weaker in power compared to Hurricane series.
3. `hmsj.online` an RPG-type server, but I play it as pure survival.
4. In dormitory, those who prefer noodles called "noodle tribe," those who prefer soup called "soup tribe," two tribes don't interfere with each other, but have unique views on instant noodles. Tangdaren series, especially Japanese tonkotsu flavor, is rare product satisfying both tribes.
5. An image tape in game "Zenless Zone Zero."
6. Noun used as verb, making instant noodles.

8. Formal name DHL Integral, generalization of Fresnel integrals, specifically in form:
 $$
 \displaystyle\int_0^\infty\sin x^n\,\mathrm dx=\frac1n\Gamma\left(\frac1n\right)\sin\left(\frac2{n\pi}\right)
